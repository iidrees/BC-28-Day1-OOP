## Introduction
The problem question:
  Create an OOP implementation by modelling a real-world scenario/problem, 
  while taking advantage of inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and 
  the other OOP concepts.

This repository contains my implementation of a BroadbandConnection Class written in
 ECMA Script 2015 along with some `Mocha` & `Chai` test.
